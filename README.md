Usage
Creating a Note
To create a new note, send a POST request to /notes with the following JSON data:

json
Copy code
{
  "title": "Note Title",
  "body": "Note Body"
}
The server will generate a unique ID for the note and return the new note object.

Retrieving Notes
To retrieve all notes, send a GET request to /notes. The server will return an array of all notes.

To retrieve a single note, send a GET request to /notes/:id, where :id is the ID of the note you want to retrieve. The server will return the note object with the specified ID.

Updating a Note
To update a note, send a PUT request to /notes/:id, where :id is the ID of the note you want to update. Include the updated note data in the request body:

json
Copy code
{
  "title": "Updated Note Title",
  "body": "Updated Note Body"
}
The server will update the note with the specified ID and return the updated note object.

Deleting a Note
To delete a note, send a DELETE request to /notes/:id, where :id is the ID of the note you want to delete. The server will remove the note with the specified ID and return a success message.

Limitations
This notes app is a simple demo that stores notes in an in-memory array. This means that the notes will only persist as long as the server is running. If the server is restarted or shut down, the notes will be lost. For a production-ready application, you'll need to use a more robust storage solution, such as a database or cloud-based storage service.
